Following is the requirement from CC side for your MTP project.


1. Writing a program in go language which can transparently send requests
to multiple squids(proxy).
2. User activity logging in the format of squid is required.
3. Scaling behavior to be studied/analysed under different load conditions
for latency.
4. Connection management with a view to balance load across the backend
squid servers.
5. Firewall connections logging feature to be implemented.



It is configured for both the ip addresses. You can ssh to the servers
using ip addresses 10.201.23.1/2/3/4/5 with userid "jayant" and passcode
"jayant@123". The following command will show you the logs for a
particular ip.

ssh 10.201.23.1

tail -f //squid.logs.datewise/access.log.20170201 | grep 10.14.31.10

cat //squid.logs.datewise/access.log.20170201 | grep 10.14.31.10


from the file name you can make out that it is a today's access file. e.g.
access.log.yyyymmdd.

So depending on the today's date you have to access the respective file
while debugging. If you have any doubts then kindly let me know.



iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -d 0/0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to-destination 127.0.0.1:3129

iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -d 0/0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.129.40.100:3129

tail -f /var/log/any_proxy.log

CC lab machine IP : 10.100.106.111

The following example redirects TCP port 25 to port 2525:

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3129

CC VM IP address : 10.201.23.17
ssh root@10.201.23.17

curl -d "uname=153050062&passwd=jayant@9764718672&submit=Login" --dump-header headers https://internet.iitb.ac.in/index.php
